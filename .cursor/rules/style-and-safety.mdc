General guidelines to keep the project consistent:

- Prefer small, composable modules over large monolithic scripts.
- Preserve existing directory structure and naming conventions whenever possible.
- Document non-obvious commands, configs, and assumptions in comments or README files; suggest updates when you change behavior.
- When resolving ambiguity, choose the option that better demonstrates:
  - Distributed Big Data principles.
  - Fault tolerance and replication.
  - Parallelism and data locality.

Security / secrets:
- Never hardcode API keys, tokens, or secrets into the repo.
- Always recommend environment variables or config files that are ignored by version control (e.g., `.env`, local config).
