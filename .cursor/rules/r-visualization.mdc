Visualization and reporting constraints for CS4480grp8:

- Final analysis and reporting must be done in **R**.
- Python plotting libraries (matplotlib, seaborn, etc.) may be used only for quick debugging, not as the final deliverable.

When generating or editing R code:
- Prefer using **ggplot2** for high-quality graphics.
- Ensure every plot has:
  - A clear title.
  - Axis labels with units where relevant.
  - Legends and readable scales.

Visuals should support **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
- Include distributions (e.g., counts of videos by time, location, tags).
- Include temporal patterns (e.g., frequency of Northern Lights videos over time).
- Include relationships between variables (e.g., location vs. sentiment, tag co-occurrence).

Audience targeting:
- Provide both:
  - **Technical plots** for data scientists (multi-facet plots, model performance metrics, density/violin plots, etc.).
  - **Simpler plots** for nontechnical stakeholders (clean bar charts, line charts, simple summaries).

Data flow into R:
- Export aggregated/summarized results from Spark via HDFS-backed formats (CSV, Parquet) or equivalent.
- Avoid one-off local exports in random paths; prefer documented, reproducible export locations.
